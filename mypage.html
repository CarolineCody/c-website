                    &emsp; I was born in Southern California and raised by my mother and father. Though their relationship was short lived I was able to appreciate technology through,
                    both of their unique perspectives. My mother was studying to be a digital artist and my father was an electrical engineer. Both were starting off their careers in the burgeoning field of computers while doing non-conventional ways. Though I did not understand the technology and code behind what I was viewing then,
                    these early impressions formed by how my parents interacted with their work had a large part to play in my field of interest.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &emsp;I started programming in high school because of the wide breadth of opportunities it had to offer. I was new to the area at the time needed time to adjust.
                    Fortunately, my quiet nature and intense personal drive to problem solve gave me a reliable way of feeling good about my work. Though I was not always the best student,
                    by putting in just a bit more time and effort I could always manage to get the project done and have something to show as my own. This perseverance would eventually land me my first internship at Quicksilver software where I learned to apply my learned experiences into practical work. It was invaluable to my learning experience at it both humbled
                    my achievements and brought weight to my work.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &emsp; From high school onwards college has been interesting, classes were of course more difficult but what I was learning was so much more rewarding. I took every opportunity
                    I could but learned to balance my capabilities and time. Eventually, I earned a spot as secretary among Engineers in Medicine and Transferred to the college of Engineering at CU Boulder. Both have helped me network extensively and I hope to do more moving forward.
